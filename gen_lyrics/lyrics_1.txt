flying over the clouds
Just like that river twisting through a dusty land
And when she shines she really shows you all she can - oh, you got to be mine
She really got to be mine
She said so
I think youre gonna be mine
She said so
I think youre gonna be
I think youre gonna be
Well tell ya
I think I'm gonna be mine
Well tell ya
flying over the clouds
Just a fun, quirky, quirky shot
Bad luck, bad luck, bad luck
So bad luck, bad luck,
Have you ever flown before
Have you flew before - yeah
Have you ever flown before
 before
Do you think you fit this shoe
?
It fits this shoe well
I think I do

Rollin
Rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' all day long
I keep on rollin' baby
I keep on rollin' baby
I'm rockin' and rollin' all day long
Doin' all the things I want you to do
Baby, doin' all the things I want you to do
Doin' all the things
Hello, look over there
Here she comes
Here comes that girl again
One that I know since I don't know when
She's gonna stop
For what I need her to do
Well don't be slow
Well said
Don't be slow
If you really want she
Don't be slow
She's found some other man
I know she don't Ann
But you
You'll like me
