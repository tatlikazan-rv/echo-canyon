flying over the clouds
Just like that river twisting through a dusty land
And when she shines she really shows you all she can - oh, you got to be hand
She really got to be mine
She said so
I think youre gonna be mine
She said so
I think youre gonna be
I think youre gonna be
Well tell ya
I think I'm gonna be mine
Well tell ya
flying over the clouds
Just a fun, quirky, quirky shot
Bad luck, bad luck, bad luck
So bad luck, bad luck,
Have you ever flown before
Have you flew before - yeah
Have you ever flown before
Do you think you fit this shoe
